###Academy-Cinemas###
This is a webpage for a movie theater, including pop-up ratings on the movie posters and a form that captures ticket ordering information.

###Pizza-Project###
This is a menu for a pizza place with a selection of toppings, which captures the input and calculates a price for the order.

###Simple-Recipes###
This is a recipe blog page, including a featured recipe section and cards for each other recipe.

###TicTacToe###
This classic game allows the user to play against the computer. The winner is celebrated with music and the gamme restarts.
